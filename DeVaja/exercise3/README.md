## Exercise 3

Source files only for the Firebase emulator version.
You need Node.js and Firebase environment to be installed with Firebase emulator to try this app. This app is intended only to be used with Firebase emulator. There are some more instructions in the comments in public/app.js file. In the production version, that is still under construction, the database rules will be more strict.

PLEASE NOTICE, that the database rules in this Firebase emulation version are not the best possible for security!

To view the source files, click the "View on GitHub" button or if you are already at DeVaja/exercise3 drawer, just browse the files.
